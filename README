jQuery ExpandText
By Michael Botsko 2011


Introduction
============================

This plugin increases or decreases text size depending on the width and height of
it's container. It works by wrapping the text in a span and measuring gradual font
changes until the width/height hits the parent limits. Since we're not calculating
string width it will work properly no matter what fonts are used.

In this example, we run the calculation every time the window is resized but that
can have a performance hit especially when there is a large difference between
your minimum and maximum font sizes.


Using
============================

Find an element and run:

$('div').expandText();

You can also pass in the minimum/maximum font sizes so things don't get out of
control:

$('div').expandText({
	min: 20,
	max: 80
});

If you want this attached to the window/document resize but need to throttle it,
check out the jQuery Resize plugin which works perfectly:
